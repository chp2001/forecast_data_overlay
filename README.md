# forecast_data_overlay

Tool for displaying varying types of forecast data simultaneously.

Initially produced by downsizing the functionality found in the [NGIAB_data_preprocess](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/NGIAB_data_preprocess) repository to just the map application and data request functionality.
